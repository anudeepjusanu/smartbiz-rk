                        of. This book presents a collection of orchestrations that exist in the relevant subjects, from
                        political and social strategy to scriptures. Essential is the endeavour to attain the
                        intellect, to be asking for everything to present the universal language and offer the
                        explanation. It is my belief to vision the entirety in the possibility of being an observer of
                        nature using undeniable perception. Therefore, uttering the reflection of human mind on life
                        and world. Deriving all the things that we can talk about in one day of existence in this

                <h5>PREFACE</h5>

                <p class="text-white">The modern intellect is always the centre of inventing the next original
                    conclusion the human and the
                    nature is to have. People are realizing how being sensitive to things of the introspection and the
                    relations and with art and culture. Therefore presented philosophy is pertinent to the way people
                    are
                    looking to be living in conjunction with forces natural.</p>

                <p class="text-white">The contents of this book reveal the generic search for attaining the divine
                    intellect and
                    sophistication in the manner of life. There are many among us that are looking to justify what they
                    feel as that something within needs to be in harmony with nature.</p>

                <p class="text-white">This book defines the ideologies and thought processes of various people and
                    schools of thought in the
                    history. It will be quite clear my opinion on the various social and political topics, that are
                    prevalent in religion today.</p>

                <p class="text-white">The organization of the information is divided into chapters and further
                    enumerated subtopics. The
                    important terms that guide the impression are noted that will help understand how the intelligence
                    is
                    presented in written content.</p>

                <p class="text-white">I for the most part have considered historical stand point to comment on various
                    things of religion and
                    ward and international politics. Therefore there is not much elusive or pertinent that has not been
                    gathered from highest level of logical reason.</p>

                <p class="text-white">Generic impression about any particular community or religion must be avoided as
                    this is just a
                    reflection of how various people and cults operate in their levels and fanaticisms of brainwashing
                    and
                    go unhindered for strange and unexplained reasons.</p>

                <p class="text-white">The idea and philosophy is simple. I want to be supportive of people that wish to
                    be independently
                    involved in a learning process that is not tainted by prejudice and propagating cults. It is the
                    beauty
                    of intellect we are talking about here, not a wayward dream.</p>

                <p class="text-white">There is a complete analysis of how the right art or ideology needs to be
                    identified and how to
                    criticize the incorrect to the precision of strategy. It is important to not be too credulous or
                    too
                    clever in the way of wading through what is just purity and intellect.</p>

                <p class="text-white">This text complements innermost desire to understand how beauty is supportive
                    and in harmony with our
                    individual existence. And talks to us in the manner of the inclusive contents of what makes the
                    complete human or any entity that reflects existence and works on the belief systems with the
                    correlations necessary to not leave the history behind.</p>

                        With the spirit that looks for a reason in the unbound space and the time that characterizes
                        the need to attain individuality, the human is relentlessly involved in defining value. There
                        is a need to reason out the ideas that became a theory and a lineage in our history. Thus,
                        discovering the verity of the entirety of indulgence in thought in our world. This book reviews
                        the responsible logic in the religion, art, science and social dispositions. The perspective is
                        of the individual that has laid the foundation to think and see things in one way. There is a
                        question on everything proposed collectively, if the equations fall into place or apart. There
                        exists truth that might not need and behave the justification from the ways of the conscience.

                <h5>PREFACE</h5>

                <p>System represents the evolution of human being in context of the available resources and ideas.
                    There is a possibility I become like one of many in its correctness or character. People do behave
                    in general to be internally one of a kind and there exists a coordinated effort to proliferate
                    ideas. So, the system is a set of people with a cultural disposition.
                </p>

                <p>First thing this system or a set of people does is to make us look back to reflect upon our own life
                    and events trying to interpret what it all means in terms of forming a belief in either religion or
                    culture.
                </p>

                <p>There needs to be a good basis to do this introspection. Great ideas let people use their own
                    experience and further experimentation to lead to understand the principles of life. This is where
                    this book and the ideas is useful, to communicate how to put things together.
                </p>

                <p>Various cults also exist that might influence their own way of interpreting and forming opinions and
                    will be criticized not to let us form our own path in liberation. Cults need to be criticized on
                    the basis of having no option or following the only alternative way of life.
                </p>

                <p>The following thoughts will definitely start the journey into forming our own ideology to lay down
                    the process and experience the divinity in the set of character that people develop and will
                    proliferate the sense of individuality unique to one person.
                </p>

                <p>I believe in individuality of the things and life that is present within us and around. The notion
                    of self can not be simplified than it is inclusive of our body, soul, thought process and our
                    character. How self centric it is, the time, is structured around the character of anything.
                </p>

                <p>Human understanding can not be simplified to inactive descriptions to be construed as simplicity.
                    Human thought processes that are associated with unique imprints in history, science, art and
                    culture are to be described with the entire complexity of space we live in.
                </p>

                <p>Apart from elaborate descriptions of the mind and thought as it happens, I have maintained the
                    credulity and its value in attaining our purpose. Some of the clever artefacts we need to be aware
                    of have been pointed using the appropriate cynicism, and negation that one would have to understand
                    from putting in some of the own perspective in perusal of the text.
                </p>

                <p>The centre of the arguments is to understand that interactions of the humans in communication, is
                    not the only interaction. There are things and species and nature and the words that are having
                    their own identity and do interact just as humans do.
